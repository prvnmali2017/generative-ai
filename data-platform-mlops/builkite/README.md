# CI/CD Workflow Definitions
This directory contains CI/CD workflow definitions using [BuildKite](https://buildkite.com/docs/tutorials/getting-started), These workflows cover testing and deployment of both ML code (for model training, batch inference, etc) and the 
Databricks ML resource definitions under ``data_platform_mlops/resources``. 

To set up CI/CD for a new project,
please refer to [ML resource config - set up CI CD](../../data_platform_mlops/resources/README.md#set-up-ci-and-cd).
