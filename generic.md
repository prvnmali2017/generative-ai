Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI is the broadest category of techniques and models that enable machines to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence.

Machine Learning (ML)
ML is a subset of AI that involves training models to learn patterns in data.

Supervised Learning
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Gradient Descent
Regularization to Avoid Overfitting
Unsupervised Learning
Anomaly Detection
Collaborative Filtering
Locality-Sensitive Hashing
Vector Space Models
N-gram Language Models
Word2vec
Word Embeddings
Parts-of-Speech Tagging
Reinforcement Learning
Q-Learning
Deep Q-Networks (DQNs)
Policy Gradients
Actor-Critic Methods
Deep Reinforcement Learning
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
Deep Learning (DL)
DL is a subset of ML that involves training models with multiple layers of artificial neural networks.

Neural Networks
Feedforward Neural Networks
Convolutional Neural Networks
Recurrent Neural Networks
Transformer Networks
Generative AI
Generative Adversarial Networks
Variational Autoencoders
Large Language Models (LLMs)
Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)
MLOps is a specific application of ML that involves managing the entire machine learning lifecycle, from data management to model deployment and monitoring.

While there may not be a single architecture diagram that explains the entire AI/ML stack, the above hierarchy should help clarify the relationships between the different concepts. Each concept builds upon the ones below it, with AI being the broadest category and MLOps being a specific application of ML.

Note that this hierarchy is not exhaustive and there may be other concepts that could fit in between or alongside the ones listed. Additionally, the boundaries between the concepts can be fuzzy, and there may be overlap or debate about how to categorize certain techniques or models.
