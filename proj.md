Studying the basics of Generative AI is a great idea, and I can certainly provide you with an overview, examples, and some code snippets to get you started. Generative AI is a fascinating field that involves creating AI models that can generate new data, such as images, text, or even music. We'll focus on text generation in this explanation.

**1. Understanding Generative AI:**
Generative AI involves creating models that can generate data, often using neural networks. It's commonly used in applications like text generation, image generation, and more. Two popular approaches for generative AI are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

**2. Example: Text Generation using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):**

RNNs are a type of neural network that can generate text sequentially. You can create a simple character-level text generator using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

Here's a basic code snippet for text generation with RNNs:

Code is in repo as gen.py

This code defines an RNN model to predict the next character in a sequence. You can train it on your own text data to create custom text generators.

**3. Lab Recording:**
To create a lab and record it for online streaming, you can follow these steps:

- Explain the concept of Generative AI, the difference between RNNs and GANs, and their applications.
- Walk through the code above, explaining each part, such as data preprocessing, model creation, training, and text generation.
- Show how to customize the code for different datasets and text generation tasks.
- Discuss potential improvements and advanced topics in generative AI.

You can use screen recording software like OBS or Zoom to record your explanation and demonstration. Make sure to explain the code clearly and address any questions that may arise.

Remember that this is just a basic example, and generative AI can become much more complex and powerful with larger datasets and more advanced models. Explore GANs and other generative models for image generation and other exciting applications in the field.
